## Context

This idea was first conceived of in order to fulfill the use case of the
creation of a decentralized Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), Whose
members would be elected by the Cosmos Community and would fulfill the role of

   - Individual compensation for all constituents of a group from the
     greater community

Election of the members of a group can be broadly
